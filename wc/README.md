# Coding Challenge: Build Your Own `wc` Tool

This coding challenge is about building your own version of the Unix command line tool `wc`. The `wc` tool is used to count words, lines, characters, and bytes in a file. For more details about this tool, you can refer to its [man page](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/wc.1.html).

## Challenge Steps

- [X] **Step Zero**: Set up your environment, download this text, and save it as `test.txt`.
- [X] **Step One**: Write a simple version of `wc` called `ccwc` that takes the `-c` option and outputs the number of bytes in a file.
- [X] **Step Two**: Support the command line option `-l` that outputs the number of lines in a file.
- [X] **Step Three**: Support the command line option `-w` that outputs the number of words in a file.
- [ ] **Step Four**: Support the command line option `-m` that outputs the number of characters in a file.
- [ ] **Step Five**: Support the default option (no options provided), which is equivalent to the `-c`, `-l`, and `-w` options.
- [ ] **The Final Step**: Support reading from standard input if no filename is specified.
